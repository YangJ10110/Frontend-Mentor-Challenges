## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The most difficult part for me was to create a background image without its property overlapping without elements, and in this difficulty I learned properties that helped me to solve this issue such as position, z-index, and more.

### Continued development

In my future projects I will be focusing on integrating multiple elements to create a more interactive display. 

### Useful resources

- [Overlay Div](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFG3BKOqOlE) - This helped me understand more how div's work along with the its capability to be overlayed. The video provides simplified context to better visualize div positioning property.
