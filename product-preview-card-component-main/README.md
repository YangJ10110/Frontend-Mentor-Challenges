### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Following on accomplishing some minor certifications resources, I thought that was sufficient to begin creating projects that can be included in developing my portfolio, but as I explore the actual skills I posses, I discovered I lacked the necessary experience to actually accomplish a project.

This project humbled me and teached me a lot regarding the real-world application of HTML and CSS my future projects will be still heavily involved in strengthening my fundamentals before moving into frameworks and projects that involves backend development.
